# sansi_examples

A sample project of how to protect your application against unauthorized copying, with the **sansi** library.

The sansi is a license manager library for Linux (x86 and ARM) and Mac (x86), by working with [Koshinto](https://koshinto.uedasoft.com/docs/) service, it provides an **out-of-the-box copy protection** feature to your application.
