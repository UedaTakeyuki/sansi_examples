# sansi_examples

This is a sample project of how to protect your application from copying, with the **sansi** library.

The sansi is a license manager library for Linux (x86 and ARM) and Mac, it provides an **out-of-the-box copy protection** feature to your application running on these.

The sansi embedded in your application can be operated through the Koshinto Service. You can download the Sansi library from your account of Koshinto, and perform all operations such as setting and changing keys from your mobile device through Koshinto's web interface.
